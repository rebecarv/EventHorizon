# üåå Event Horizon

An interactive website exploring the mysteries and science of black holes, built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React.

## üìã Overview

Event Horizon is an immersive web experience that creates a captivating journey through the fascinating world of black holes. The website features a stunning scroll-based animation where stars are gradually pulled toward a central black hole as users scroll down, creating an increasingly intense gravitational distortion effect. The black hole's accretion disk rotates with your scrolling motion, while information cards appear at strategic points to educate visitors about black hole physics and phenomena.
